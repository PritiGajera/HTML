				WhatsApp (also called WhatsApp Messenger) is an internationally
				available freeware, cross-platform, centralized instant messaging (IM)
				and voice-over-IP (VoIP) service owned by American company Meta
				Platforms.[11] It allows users to send text and voice messages,[12] make
				voice and video calls, and share images, documents, user locations, and
				other content.[13][14] WhatsApp's client application runs on mobile
				devices, and can be accessed from computers.[15] The service requires a
				cellular mobile telephone number to sign up.[16] In January 2018,
				WhatsApp released a standalone business app called WhatsApp Business
				which can communicate with the standard WhatsApp client.[17][18] The
				client application was created by WhatsApp Inc. of Mountain View,
				California, which was acquired by Facebook in February 2014 for
				approximately US$19.3 billion.[19][20] It became the world's most
				popular messaging application by 2015,[21][22] and had more than 2
				billion users worldwide by February 2020.[23] By 2016, it had become the
				primary means of Internet communication in regions including Latin
				America, the Indian subcontinent, and large parts of Europe and
				Africa.[21]
